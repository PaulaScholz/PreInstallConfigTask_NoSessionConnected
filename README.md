# PreInstalledConfigTask - No SessionConnected

This sample is exactly like PreInstalledConfigTask except that it does not contain a SessionConnected task.
It may be used for starting the UWP application once after first logon and also launches a Toast notification.

It does contain the UpdateTask, which will launch a Toast notification when the application's build number
is incremented.
